geolocation-noapp
=================

This is the repo from which the Sencha app (dev-cycle-mobile-app) https://github.com/tofferrosen/devcycle-mobile-app/tree/master/cordova/plugins/com.tourtrak.geoplugin pulls from. Every time a change is made to the iOS plugin. This is a temporary repository until the application is complete. 
Once the plugin is complete the repository will become unnecessary, since it will be in a final state used for the TourTrak application. 

The plugin uses CoreLocation and CoreData to record location data in a local app database, then sends the location data to DCS.
